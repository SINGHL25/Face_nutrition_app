This Streamlit-based app predicts potential nutrient deficiencies (like Vitamin D, B12, Omega-3, Iron, etc.) from a face image.

## Features
- Upload face image
- Simulated AI-based nutrient analysis
- Beautiful Streamlit UI
- Easily deployable to Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This version is a simulation using randomized scores. Medical-grade AI would require a trained facial biomarker model.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-nutrition-ai.git
cd face-nutrition-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

Future Goals
Integrate deep learning model (e.g. MobileNet, EfficientNet)

Connect with HuggingFace Vision Transformer
